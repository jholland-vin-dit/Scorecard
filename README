The code in this repo is what is running the site at scorecard.montgomerycountygreenparty.org.  It is not yet
made "generic" to use for other sites, although with some programming you can certainly do so. To use it you
need to create a Mysql database using the sql script given here, and install the php etc files in an apache web server
with php support. The connection php file will contain the connection information to connect to the database. The 
intended use is to have a pretty fixed sets of issues and voters that votes belong to. The votes can be edited and maintained by
the end users, who come in two levels (see the user manual). To edit the voters and issues themselves requires using something
to connect to mysql and manipulating the tables. Eventually these tables should have a user interface to edit them.


There is code in here that reflects some other possible scenarios that were not realized and should be ignored or
eventually removed.

There is a branch that has a postgresql version of the code, but it is out of date relative to the mysql code.

The application-specific values for logo, title, colors, etc, are not well separated from the code. That is something
else that needs to be done to make it more usable for other sites.

The passwords are stored as SHA-256 hashes so to set an initial password for a user you will need to use a function
that will do that conversion.

The intention is for this to be a usable tool for people keeping track of voting records of organizations in general. It
is licensed under GNU Affero GPL and forks and contributions are welcomed. The goal is to have something online to
keep elected officials accountable.
