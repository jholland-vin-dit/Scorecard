<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>About
this scorecard</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Origin</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
scorecard was begun in 1989 by the Montgomery County League of
Environmental Voters (MCLEV) of Montgomery County, Maryland.  A
coalition of environmental, conservation, and civic groups created a
county-level version of the state’s Maryland League of
Environmental Voters Scorecard, and “granddaughter” of the
national League of Conservation Voters Scorecard.  That scorecard,
for 1991-1994, was effective in communicating the real political
behavior of Council members to the general public.  The scorecard
educated the community on the important environmental votes, and
provided clear and transparent accountability to the voters on the
Council members they had elected.  When the chips were down – who
really stood up for the environment, for the average citizen, and for
the future?  Many volunteers spent hundreds of hours painstakingly
discussing, researching, documenting, and publishing that scorecard
in booklet form.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Today</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With
the advent of the Internet, we can now make this accountability tool
available easily to everyone, and include many more issues across the
spectrum of progressive concerns.  The reader can link to websites to
learn more about each vote’s factual background and political
landscape, and become involved on issues of their choosing.  The
scorecard can also be updated continuously throughout the four-year
Council session, to help voters and the press understand the actual
values being implemented by their representative, regardless of
rhetoric and symbolic actions.  The local Green Party of Montgomery
County created this scorecard software, and populated it based on
information from many activist groups, the general media, and Council
records.  As with the original scorecard, the intent is to educate
the public on issues of critical local importance; and provide a
clear record of when our elected officials stood up for our
environment, our people, progressive values, and the future.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Call
for Increased Council Transparency</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
research for this scorecard, we found that the transparency of County
Council votes is dismal.  The final vote on a bill is posted in the
online Council records, while the earlier votes in committee and
amendments -- all public, official votes -- are not online.  This
lack of transparency functions as a cover for the deal-making when
real decisions are made on the content of the bills, and members’
votes are hard to determine.  Then, members use unanimous final votes
for press releases and the public, while their true influence may
have been the opposite.  This lack of transparency includes the
following, which we recommend improving by the Council with online
posting of all official votes:</FONT></FONT></P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Votes
	on amendments in the full Council voting sessions</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Votes
	on amendments in the six standing committees VERIFY</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Titles
	of bills written to hide the purpose and impact on the citizens. 
	For instance, a $900,000 special exemption from a county hotel tax
	proposed in 2010 to benefit a single company was titled “rental
	transient tax,&quot; which created an apparently objective
	redefinition of transient but it was in fact a tax subsidy to
	benefit one company, which is also one of the richest companies in
	the world (Bill 44-10, for Lockheed Martin).  Fortunately, the
	Council’s original denial of this classic pork barrel handout was
	confirmed with a second denial by the Council, but the misleading
	title problem continues.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Budget
	amendment votes.  They have no identifying number or tracking system
	even for full, final Council action, and so are also nearly
	impossible to find.  Multi-million-dollar decisions become virtually
	invisible to the voting public. VERIFY</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By
using detailed information from first hand press coverage of the
various sessions, activist leaders, and issue websites, we present
the substantively critical votes to document when our Councilmembers
showed their true positions on issues.  It might have been an
amendment in committee, an amendment during full Council
consideration, or a final vote.  When an illuminating vote is not
available and the only recorded vote was unanimous, the issue might
not be included unless the issue itself is of major importance.  This
is not meant to be a comprehensive record of votes on an issue, but
to capture the political role played by our elected officials on an
issue for electoral visibility.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Explanation
of votes</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
votes chosen for this scorecard include issues that were considered
important by progressive leaders because of their impact on the
county’s environment, communities, individual rights, sustainable
economy, and our core values of justice, freedom, equality, and
transparency.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each
Councilmember’s score is the correct number of desired votes
(“desired vote” is explained at the bottom of each bill’s
description), divided by the number of votes that particular member
voted.  If a committee vote is included, then members not on that
committee do not have that vote counted for or against them.  If a
member abstained or was absent for a critical vote, it is counted
against them unless they were absent for a significant personal
reason, since their job is to vote even if difficult, and not avoid
that responsibility by absenting themselves from the room.  If a
member was not on the Council at the time of the vote, the entry is
Not Applicable, and the votes is not counted for or against them.</FONT></FONT></P>
